   <h3>I don't eat pork</h3>
    <p>
      One of my theses in college was on Neurocysticercosis and I haven't been
      able to eat pork since.

    <h3>I have never had a Big Mac</h3>
    <p>
      I'm Lovin it, You're Lovin it, We're all Lovin it! Mcdonald's french fries
      are my favorite, but somehow I've never had a Mcdonald's signature BIG
      MAC!

    <h3>I was trending on twitter in Chile (My major claim to fame!)</h3>
    <p>
      Ever heard of "La Gringa Loca"? Probably not! But if you were Chilean
      there'd be a good chance you would have! A crazy Chile loving Gringa, that's me!
